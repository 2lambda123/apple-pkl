We distinguish between *release* versions built from tip of `main` branch
and *dev* versions built from tip of `dev` branch.

== preferred version scheme (semver)
release version         : 0.9.0
dev version (unique)    : 0.9.0-dev+6bd8216
dev version (non-unique): 0.9.0-dev

== version scheme for maven (gradle build's `project.version` is set to this)
release version         : 0.9.0
dev version (non-unique): 0.9.0-SNAPSHOT

== version scheme for (doc) urls
release version               : .../0.9.0/...
last published release version: .../current/...
last published dev version    : .../latest/...
